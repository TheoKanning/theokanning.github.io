After getting on TV in season 6, I had high hopes for season 7. I trained harder than before and put together a much more impressive video in my opinion. While the 3 minute deadline kept me from adding as much humor as I wanted, I'm still proud of the end result.

Unfortunately, I never received a call to be on the show. This season NBC could only take 1 in 100 applicants, so I guess I'm not too upset about it, but that won't stop me from trying again next year!
