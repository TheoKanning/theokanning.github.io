I grew up watching the original Ninja Warrior show from Japan, and I dreamed of being able to compete on it. I got into training for American Ninja Warrior after joining the UMN Gymnastics Club in college, and they inspired me to make an audition tape for season 6. I had seen a lot of boring audition videos that were way too serious, so I wanted to make mine as silly as I could. I definitely succeeded in that respect.

Apparently I made it silly enough to get on to the show, and I competed in the Denver Regional in May 2014.

Unfortunately, I fell on the fourth obstacle when my left hand slipped off the spike. As a small consolation, my fall was funny enough to get me on TV.

I dried myself off and started training for season 7. Overall it was a ton of fun, but I know I could have done better.
